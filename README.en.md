## ✨ Core Features

- **Real-Time Multiplayer** — WebSocket connections, 1–8 players per room
- **AI Dungeon Master** — Immersive narrative driven by Gemini 2.5 Flash
- **Character Creation** — Race/class/stat allocation (MH simplified to weapon-select-and-play)
- **D&D 5e Combat** — Full dice resolution, attack/skill/critical hit system
- **MP Mana System** — Resource management for spellcasting classes
- **Dynamic Difficulty** — Server code auto-scales monster stats based on party size
- **External Memory** — Persistent game state, automatic conversation trimming, constant token usage
- **Save/Load** — Save progress anytime, load across rooms to continue
- **AFK System** — Auto-AFK after 60 seconds of inactivity; NPC takes over the character
- **Absent Player Handling** — Automatically detects absent players on load; characters are controlled by NPCs
- **BGM Background Music** — YouTube auto-switches scene music (with fallback)
- **Boss Key** — Press Esc to toggle a disguise screen
- **Character Color System** — Each character has a unique color; narration in white, options in cyan

### Monster Hunter Exclusive
- 🐱 **Cart Mechanic** — Faint 3 times and the quest fails; monsters don't recover HP
- ⚔️ **Part Breaks** — Breaking head/tail/wings affects monster abilities
- 🎯 **Capture System** — Limp → Trap → Tranq Bomb; capture rewards are more plentiful
- 🛒 **Code-Controlled Shop** — The general store is handled entirely by server code, bypassing AI
- 📈 **Code-Controlled Leveling** — Auto-level up when EXP threshold is reached; HP calculated by code dice rolls

## 🏗️ Technical Highlights

- **Gemini Untrusted Principle** — Leveling, shop, difficulty, and option numbering are all controlled by code, not AI
- **Option Mapping** — Players input a number; code looks it up and sends the corresponding text command to Gemini
- **External Memory** — Game state (HP/gold/items) is parsed from AI responses and injected into the next message
- **Dynamic Difficulty** — Code calculates HP multipliers and attack modifiers based on party size
- **Heartbeat Keep-Alive** — 15-second ping prevents Cloudflare's 90-second timeout from dropping the connection
- **Disconnect & Reconnect** — Room is preserved for 5 minutes; host and players can reconnect
